A tool to search LittleBigArchive levels.

# How do I use this?

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrQJU4NGE-A) is a video demonstrating how to use this tool.
if you don't have any level archive you can get the one you like from [LittleBigArchive](http://littlebigarchive.com/)

**when you open LittleBigSearch**

1. press the browse button and locate your **\LBP2 Levels Archive\PS3\SAVEDATA** or LBP1.. 3...
2. when you find the level you want click on it and that will copy the path for you to find it.
3. take the level folder name from the path ex: BCUS98245LEVEL5CAD9BFA and use it to get your level from the archive.
4. copy the levels you want and paste them in your **\RPCS3\dev_hdd0\home\00000001\savedata**.
5. start LBP and go to your moon, press ***Square*** on any empty spot-> ***import***.
