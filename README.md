A tool to search LittleBigArchive levels.

##### How do I use this?

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrQJU4NGE-A) is a video demonstrating how to use this tool.

1. if you don't have any levels archive you can get the one you like from [LittleBigArchive](http://littlebigarchive.com/)
2. when you open LittleBigSearch press the browse button and locate your **\LBP2 Levels Archive\PS3\SAVEDATA** or LBP1 or 3...
3. when you find the level you want click on it and that will give you the path to find it.
4. cut the level folder name from the full path
