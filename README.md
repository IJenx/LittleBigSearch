# How do I use this?

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrQJU4NGE-A) is a video demonstrating how to use this tool.
if you don't have any level archive you can get the one you like from [LittleBigArchive](http://littlebigarchive.com/)

**when you open LittleBigSearch**

1. press the browse button and locate your **\LBP2 Levels Archive\PS3\SAVEDATA** or LBP1.. 3...
2. when you find the level you want click on it and that will copy the path for you to find it.
3. take the level folder name from the path ex: BCUS98245LEVEL5CAD9BFA and use it in the search box of the archive directory to copy it.
4. copy the levels you want and paste them in your **\RPCS3\dev_hdd0\home\00000001\savedata**.
5. start LBP and go to your moon, press ***Square*** on any empty spot -> ***import***. 


# How can I trust this

This tool was originally a command line tool to find my own LBP2 levels in LittleBigArchive, because it was quite impossible to search 7000 folder to find one level. I thought it would be cool to build a GUI and share it with LBP community. 

**But windows defender is tellimg me this app is dangerous**

The app used to bind enter key with the search button so its more convenient to search.. and that was a dangerous crime according to windows defender. Windows defender though I used this app as a [Keylogger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystroke_logging) so I had to remove the bind. It shouldn't tell you about it now, this is just in case someone is having it. if windows told you this app is from an unknonw publisher you can just press ***show more details*** than press run anyways.
